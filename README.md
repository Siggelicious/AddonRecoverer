# AddonRecoverer
A small program to help you recover your addon settings after an unexpected crash. Works for both World of Warcraft and World of Warcraft: Classic. 
# Usage
Move AddonRecoverer.exe into your ``World of Warcraft\...\WTF`` and run it. The program will recursively iterate through all of the child folders so don't start it anywhere else!
